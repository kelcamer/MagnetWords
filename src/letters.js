/* Grapheme-colour map — the Fisher-Price alphabet magnets.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   Copied from SpecialInterests/src/data/synesthesia.js so this page and
   the index title colour every letter identically. Change one, change
   both.

   The magnets (sold 1971-1990) run the rainbow minus indigo, cycling
   from A:

       red · orange · yellow · green · blue · purple

   So A is red, B orange, C yellow, D green, E blue, F purple, and G
   starts over. Witthoft, Winawer & Eagleman (2015, PLoS ONE
   10(3):e0118996, PMID 25739095) found >6% of 6,588 American
   synesthetes learned many of their letter colours from this toy, about
   15% of those born 1975-1980; their note that G and Y are red in the toy is what fixes the
   cycle's phase.

   The colour belongs to the letter, never to its position: every "e" is
   the same blue wherever it sits in a word. */
